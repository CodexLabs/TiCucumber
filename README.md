# TiCucumber Package

Yes. Cucumber (specifically Calabash) for Appcelerator Alloy iOS and Android

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install -g TiCucumber`



## Documentation
_(Coming soon)_

for right now this package will heavily depend on ruby. deal with it. Ruby is a fantastic language anyway.
If this is a program that the titanium community cares about then please help me either move this entirely into javascript or help make the ruby parts work smoothly. I am basically pulling into calabash-android and calabash-ios and doing some titanium specific stuff to it.



## Examples
_(Coming soon)_

## Contributing
