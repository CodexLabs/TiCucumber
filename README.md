Titanium Cucumber Package
---

	THIS IS A PLACE HOLDER PACKAGE. I WILL MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR WHEN THIS BECOMES A REAL PACKAGE.
	I AM TYING THIS NAME UP SO THAT NO ONE ELSE GETS ANY CUTE IDEAS :-)	


for right now this package will heavily depend on ruby. deal with it. Ruby is a fantastic language anyway.
If this is a program that the titanium community cares about then please help me either move this entirely into javascript or help make the ruby parts work smoothly. I am basically pulling into calabash-android and calabash-ios and doing some titanium specific stuff to it.
